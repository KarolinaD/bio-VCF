\section {Retrieving records from phasing files}

This chapter gives an overview of the usage of phasing files parser included in \verb|Bio.VCF| \verb|phase| module.
This module makes handling haplotype data easier, allowing users to retrieve particular records from phasing files
and even filtering SNPs by matching them to those included in VCF file.

The whole module is specifficaly written for handling data from \href{ftp://ftp.hapmap.org/hapmap/phasing/2009-02_phaseIII/HapMap3_r2/}{HapMap 3} project.
Format of the data handled by functions is as staded in \href{ftp://ftp.hapmap.org/hapmap/phasing/2009-02_phaseIII/HapMap3_r2/hapmap3_r2_phasing_summary.doc}{hapmap3_r2_phasing_summary.doc},
but also assuming that SNPs in those files are sorted increasingly by position.
Important thing is, if you are downloading the .phased file to your computer, rather not change the file name as it gives important
information not stated anywhere in the file. Files without original name will be parsed normally but will lack in information like:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item chromosome
  \item region
  \item if the file is for unrelated haplotypes, duos or trios.
\end{enumerate}
